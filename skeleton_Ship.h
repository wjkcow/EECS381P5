/***** Ship Class *****/
/* A Ship has a name, initial position, amount of fuel, and parameters that govern its movement.
The initial amount of fuel is equal to the supplied fuel capacity - a full fuel tank.
A Ship can be commanded to move to either a position or follow a course, or stop,
dock at or refuel at an Island. It consumes fuel while moving, and becomes immobile
if it runs out of fuel. It inherits the Sim_object interface to the rest of the system,
and the Track_base class provides the basic movement functionality, with the unit of time
corresponding to 1.0 for one "tick" - an hour of simulated time.

The update function updates the position and/or state of the ship.
The describe function outputs information about the ship state.
Accessors make the ship state available to either the public or to derived classes.
The is a "fat interface" for the capabilities of derived types of Ships. These
functions are implemented in this class to throw an Error exception.
*/

/* 
This skeleton file shows the required public and protected interface for the class, which you may not modify. 
If no protected members are shown, there must be none in your version. 
If any protected or private members are shown here, then your class must also have them and use them as intended.
You may define simple reader functions in the class declaration if you wish 
by changing the prototype to the definition. Your .h file for a component will always
be kept together with your .cpp file for the component.
You should delete this comment.
